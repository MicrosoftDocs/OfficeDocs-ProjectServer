# Install SharePoint Server 2013 (Project Server 2013)
 
 **Summary:** Install SharePoint Server 2013 and create a server farm prior to installing Project Server 2013.<br/>
**Applies to:** Project Server 2013
  
Before you can install Project Server 2013, you must install SharePoint Server 2013 and create a SharePoint Server 2013 farm. You must also start the State Service on the SharePoint farm.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Project Server 2013 requires the Enterprise edition of SharePoint Server 2013. Prior versions of SharePoint Server and SharePoint Foundation 2013 are not supported. 
  
If you have a SharePoint Server 2013 farm configured and you are ready to install Project Server 2013, proceed to the next article, [Install and configure Project Server 2013](install-and-configure-project-server-2013.md).
  
If you have not yet installed SharePoint Server 2013, it is important to carefully plan your SharePoint Server 2013 farm before installing SharePoint Server 2013. For detailed information about planning your SharePoint Server 2013 farm, see [Plan for SharePoint 2013](/SharePoint/getting-started).
  
If you have completed the planning phase of your SharePoint Server 2013 deployment, see [Multiple servers for a three-tier farm (SharePoint Server 2013)](/SharePoint/install/install-sharepoint-server-2016-across-multiple-servers) for detailed information about deploying SharePoint Server 2013.
  
When you have completed SharePoint Server 2013 deployment, proceed to [Install and configure Project Server 2013](install-and-configure-project-server-2013.md).
