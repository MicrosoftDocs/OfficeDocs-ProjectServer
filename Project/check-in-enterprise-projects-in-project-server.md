# Check-in enterprise projects in Project Server
 
 **Summary:** You can force the check-in an enterprise project by using Project Web App.<br/>
**Applies to:** Project Server Subscription Edition, Project Server 2019, Project Server 2016, Project Server 2013
  
You can force the check-in of an enterprise project that is checked out. Note that forcing a check-in of a project that is being modified by a user may result in the loss of those changes. We highly recommend that users check in projects in the typical manner and that you use force check-in only when it is necessary.
  
Use the following procedure to force check-in enterprise projects.
  
### To force check-in enterprise projects

1. On the Project Web App home page, on the **Settings** menu, click **Project Web App Settings**.
    
2. On the Server Settings page, in the **Queue and Database Administration** section, click **Force Check-in Enterprise Objects**.
    
3. From the **Select the type of object you want to force check-in** drop-down list, select **Enterprise Projects**.
    
4. Select the projects that you want to check in.
    
5. Click **Check In**.
