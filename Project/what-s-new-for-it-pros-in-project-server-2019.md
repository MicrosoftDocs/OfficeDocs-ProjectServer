# What's new for IT pros in Project Server 2019 
  **Summary:** Learn about Project Server 2019. Find information on the latest features and capabilities and get an overview of its new and updated functionality.<br/>
**Applies to:** Project Server 2019 
  
This article provides a brief overview of new and significantly updated functionality in Project Server 2019, with a particular emphasis on the areas of interest to IT professionals. These include the following:
  

    
- [Base installation languages and language packs](what-s-new-for-it-pros-in-project-server-2019.md#Lang)
    
- [Hardware and software requirements](what-s-new-for-it-pros-in-project-server-2019.md#Req)
    
- [Upgrading to Project Server 2019 Public Prevew ](what-s-new-for-it-pros-in-project-server-2019.md#Upgra)
    
- [Project Web App changes](what-s-new-for-it-pros-in-project-server-2019.md#PWAChanges)
    
   
## Base installation languages and language packs
<a name="Lang"> </a>

 Now that both the Project Server 2019 and SharePoint Server 2019 are installed through a single installation, the base language is automatically matched for both. For example, when you install SharePoint Server 2019 (English - US), the base installation language for both Project Server 2019 and SharePoint Server 2019 will be English - US. 
  
There is a special case in which the base installation language for SharePoint Server 2019 and Project Server 2019 do not match:
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**SharePoint Server 2019** <br/> |**Project Server 2019** <br/> |
|Thai  <br/> |English  <br/> |
   
 **Language packs**
  
SharePoint Server 2019 language packs will also match languages for both Project Server 2019 and SharePoint Server 2019. Individual language packs for Project Server 2019 are not available. 
  
Since Project Server 2019 does not provide a matching language for all available SharePoint Server 2019 language packs, an alternate language is provided. The following table lists SharePoint Server 2019 language packs in which an alternate Project Server 2019 language is provided.
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**SharePoint Server 2019 language pack** <br/> |**Project Server 2019 language** <br/> |
|Azeri (Latin)  <br/> |English  <br/> |

## Upgrading to Project Server 2019 
<a name="Upgra"> </a>

When planning to upgrade to Project Server 2019 take note of the following: 
  
- **Upgrade only through Project Server 2016** - If you are upgrading from earlier versions of Project Server, you must upgrade your databases to Project Server 2016 first in order to upgrade to Project Server 2019. There is no direct upgrade path from Project Server 2013 to Project Server 2019.
    
- **Project Web App site collection upgrade** - The SharePoint 2016 content database that contains your PWA site collection needs to be upgraded as well during the upgrade process.
    
- **No in-place upgrade** - You must first create a Project Server 2019 farm, and then attach and upgrade your Project Server 2016 databases to the new farm. In-place upgrade is not supported.
    
- **Upgrade through Microsoft PowerShell** - Similar to the Project Server 2016 upgrade experience, upgrading to Project Server 2019 will be through the use of PowerShell cmdlets.
    
- **Migrate your Project Server 2016 Resource Plans** -  You can migrate your Project Server 2016 Resource Plans to Resource Engagements in Project Server 2019. 
    
For more detailed information about the upgrade process, see [Upgrading to Project Server 2019](upgrading-to-project-server-2019.md).
