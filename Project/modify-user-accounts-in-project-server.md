# Modify user accounts in Project Server
 
 **Summary:** Edit user accounts by using the Manage Users page in Project Web App Settings.<br/>
**Applies to:** Project Server 2019, Project Server 2016, Project Server 2013
  
In Project Server permission mode, you can modify existing account information for any user. You might want to do this, for example, if a resource name is changed or if a resource changes roles in your organization. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you are using SharePoint permission mode, see [Plan SharePoint groups in Project Server](plan-sharepoint-groups-in-project-server.md) for information about managing users in Project Web App.
  
## Before you begin

> [!NOTE]
>  Because SharePoint Server 2016 runs as websites in Internet Information Services (IIS), administrators and users depend on the accessibility features that browsers provide. SharePoint Server 2016 supports the accessibility features of supported browsers. For more information, see the following resources:> [Plan browser support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=246502)> [Accessibility for SharePoint Products](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/94ad4316-1077-400a-b17e-a2085a5a7312.aspx)> [Accessibility features in SharePoint 2013 Products](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=246501)> [Keyboard shortcuts](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=246504)> [Touch](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=246506)
  
Before you begin this operation, review the following information about prerequisites:
  
- Read [Manage users in Project Server](manage-users-in-project-server.md) .
    
- You must have access to Project Web App.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The **Manage users and groups** global permission in Project Web App is required to complete this procedure.
