# Customize approval options for Project Web App workflows
 
 **Summary:** Learn how to add additional approval options to a Project Web App workflow approval task.<br/>
**Applies to:** Project Server Subscription Edition, Project Server 2019, Project Server 2016, Project Server 2013
  
When using approval tasks in your workflows, it is often desirable to have additional options beyond Approved and Rejected. For example, you may want those submitting the proposal to do some additional groundwork on the project and then resubmit before you make the final Approved or Rejected decision.
  
In this article, we'll look at how to add a third option — we'll call it  *Revise and Resubmit*  — to the list of options in the workflow approval task.
  
## Before you begin
<a name="begin"> </a>

Before starting, make sure:
  
- If you are using an on-premises deployment of Project Server, you have set up the [SharePoint 2013 workflow platform](/SharePoint/governance/workflow-in-sharepoint-server).
    
- You have created the sample workflow, stages, and enterprise project type as described in [Create a sample Project Web App workflow](create-a-sample-project-web-app-workflow.md).
    
## Add a new task approval option
<a name="proc1"> </a>

The first thing that we need to do is to add the new Revise and Resubmit option to the existing list of approval options. This is done in the site settings for the Project Web App site.
  
### To modify the task approval options

1. In Project Web App, click **Settings**, and then click **Site settings**.
    
2. Under **Web Designer Galleries**, click **Site content types**.
    
3. Under **List Content Types**, click **Workflow Task (SharePoint 2013)**.
    
4. Under **Columns**, click **Task Outcome**.
    
5. Click the **Edit site column** link.
    
6. In the **Type each choice on a separate line** box, addRevise and Resubmit on a separate line between **Approved** and **Rejected**.
    
7. Click **OK**.
    
## Create the workflow

We'll be using the Sample Workflow that you created in [Create a sample Project Web App workflow](create-a-sample-project-web-app-workflow.md) to build a workflow that looks like this:

If you've completed the procedures in other articles in this series, you may already have part of this workflow in place. The complete steps for creating this workflow are in the following procedure.

## Test it out

### To create a project

1. In Project Web App, in the left navigation, click **Projects**.
    
2. On the ribbon, click the **Projects** tab.
    
3. Click **New**, and then click **Sample Project Type**.
    
4. Name the project **Customize approval options**, and then click **Save**.
    
5. On the Workflow Status page, click **Submit**, and then click **OK**.
    
Submitting the project will move the workflow to Stage 2, triggering our approval task. (Note that the Current Workflow Stage on the Workflow Status page is **2 - Request review**.) The next step is to select an outcome for the task.
  
### To choose an outcome for a task

1. Log into Project Web App as the user to whom you assigned the task.
    
2. In Project Web App, in the left navigation, click **Approvals**.
    
3. On the ribbon, click **Workflow Approvals**.
    
4. On the Workflow Tasks list, click **All Tasks**.
    
5. Click **Customize approval options**.
    
6. On the ribbon, click **Edit**.
    
7. Click **Revise and Resubmit**.
    
On the Workflow Status page, note that the Current Workflow Stage has returned to **1 - Propose idea**. (You can also [use the Stage Status to leave a message for your users](set-the-stage-status-in-a-project-web-app-workflow.md) about the need to revise their proposal.) Users can now update the project proposal materials and resubmit the project again to create another approval task.
  
Try creating another project and choosing **Approved** or **Rejected** for the task. You'll notice that the workflow stage moves to **3 - Execute** or **4 - Cancelled** respectively.
  
In this case, we added a single additional option — Revise and Resubmit — to the approval task. You can add additional options depending on your needs, and configure the workflow to react differently to each one.
