# Project Professional Versions (Project Server 2013 settings)
 
 **Summary:** Use the Project Professional Versions setting to define which builds of Project Professional 2013 can connect to Project Server 2013.<br/>
**Applies to:** Project Server 2013
  
  
 **Project Professional Versions** is a part of the Additional Server Settings in the **Operational Policies** section of Project Server 2013 Server Settings. In Project Server 2013, these setting are available in SharePoint Central Administration. To access and configure this setting, you must be a farm administrator.
  
## Project Professional Versions

 **Project Professional Versions** lets you specify which versions (build numbers) of the Project Professional client will be able to connect to your Project Server 2013 environment. This setting lets you ensure that Project Professional client connections to the server are all at a required base level. For example, if you recently updated both Project Server 2013 and Project Professional 2013 to the same cumulative update, you can verify that all clients that connect to the server are at least at this level by entering the build number. All Project Professional 2013 clients that have not been updated to the specified cumulative update or a newer version will be unable to connect.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Project Professional 2013 is the only Project Professional client that can connect to Project Server 2013.
