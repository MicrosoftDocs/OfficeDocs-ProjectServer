# Deploy Project Web App in an existing site collection (Project Server 2013)
 
 **Summary:** Deploy an instance of Project Web App to an existing site collection and create a Project Web App site.
  
Deploying an instance of Project Web App to an existing site collection consists of the following:
  
- Enable the Project Web App site collection features
    
- Create a Project Web App site
    
If you have already enabled the Project Web App site collection features (for example, if you imported SharePoint list projects into Project Web App), then a Project Web App instance already exists in the site collection, and you can proceed to create a Project Web App site.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Only one Project Web App site can be created per site collection. 
  
For information on enabling the Project Web App site collection features, see [Enable the Project Web App site collection features in Project Server 2016](enable-the-project-web-app-site-collection-features-in-project-server-2016.md).
  
For information on creating a Project Web App site in an existing site collection, see [Create a PWA site in an existing site collection](create-a-pwa-site-in-an-existing-site-collection.md).
