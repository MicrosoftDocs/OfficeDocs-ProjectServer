# Assign an approval task in a workflow
 
 **Summary:** Learn how to add an approval task to a Project Web App workflow.<br/>
**Applies to:** Project Server Subscription Edition, Project Server 2019, Project Server 2016, Project Server 2013
  
By including an approval task in your Project Web App workflow, you can ensure that your projects receive proper approval before they get underway. In this article, we'll look at an example of using an approval task in a workflow to allow selected users to approve or reject a project.
  
## Before you begin
<a name="begin"> </a>

Before starting, make sure:
  
- If you are using an on-premises deployment of Project Server, you have set up the [SharePoint 2013 workflow platform](/SharePoint/governance/workflow-in-sharepoint-server).
    
- You have created the sample workflow, stages, and enterprise project type as described in [Create a sample Project Web App workflow](create-a-sample-project-web-app-workflow.md).
    
## Create a workflow with an approval task

We'll be using the Sample Workflow that you created in [Create a sample Project Web App workflow](create-a-sample-project-web-app-workflow.md) to build a workflow that looks like this:

If you've completed the procedures in other articles in this series, you may already have part of this workflow in place. The complete steps for creating this workflow are in the following procedure.

2. Connect to your Project Web App site.
    
3. On the left, click **Workflows**.
    
4. Click **Sample Workflow**.
    
5. Click **Edit workflow**.
    
6. On the ribbon, click **Stage**, and then click **1 - Propose idea**.
    
7. Place the orange cursor in the top section of **Stage 1** and, on the ribbon, click **Action**, and then, under **Project Web App Actions**, click **Wait for Project Event**.
    
8. Click **this project event**, and choose **Event: When a project is submitted** from the dropdown menu.

## Test it out

With the workflow published, we can create a sample project to see how the approval task works.
  
### To create a project

1. In Project Web App, in the left navigation, click **Projects**.
    
2. On the ribbon, click the **Projects** tab.
    
3. Click **New**, and then click **Sample Project Type**.
    
4. Name the project **Assign an approval task**, and then click **Save**.
    
5. On the Workflow Status page, click **Submit**, and then click **OK** to confirm.
    
Once the project has been created and submitted, you'll notice that the Current Workflow Stage is **1 - Propose idea**. The workflow will pause here until the user to whom you assigned the approval task approves or rejects the project.
  
Let's take a look at what happens when the user approves the task.
  
### To approve a task

1. Log into Project Web App as the user to whom you assigned the task.
    
2. In Project Web App, in the left navigation, click **Approvals**.
    
3. On the ribbon, click **Workflow Approvals**.
    
4. On the Workflow Tasks list, click **All Tasks**.
    
5. Click **Assign an approval task**.
    
6. On the ribbon, click **Edit**.
    
7. Click **Approved**.
    
Notice that once the task has been approved, the Current Workflow Stage is **3 - Execute**. Try creating another project, and this time choose **Rejected** for the approval task. Note that the Current Workflow Stage is **4 - Cancelled**.
  
In the next article, we'll look at how to [add an additional approval option to the approval task](customize-approval-options-for-project-web-app-workflows.md).
