# Deploy Project Web App in an existing site collection (Project Servers 2016 or 2019)
 
 **Summary:** Deploy an instance of Project Web App to an existing site collection and create a Project Web App site.<br/>
**Applies to:** Project Server 2016, Project Server 2019 
  
Deploying an instance of Project Web App to an existing site collection consists of the following:
  
- Create a Project Web App site
    
- Enable the Project Web App site collection features
    
If you have already enabled the Project Web App site collection features (for example, if you imported SharePoint list projects into Project Web App), then a Project Web App instance already exists in the site collection, and you can proceed to create a Project Web App site.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Only one Project Web App site can be created per content database. 
  
For information on enabling the Project Web App site collection features, see [Enable the Project Web App site collection features in Project Server 2016](enable-the-project-web-app-site-collection-features-in-project-server-2016.md).
  
For information on creating a Project Web App site in an existing site collection, see [Create a PWA site in an existing site collection](create-a-pwa-site-in-an-existing-site-collection.md).
