# Installation and deployment overview for Project Server 2013
 
 **Summary:** Learn about the steps involved in installing Project Server 2013 in a server farm environment.<br/>
**Applies to:** Project Server 2013
  
This series of articles describes the steps necessary to install Project Server 2013 in a server farm environment. These steps include the following:
  
- Configure SQL Server and SQL Server Analysis Services
    
- Install SharePoint Server 2013
    
- Install Project Server 2013
    
- Create a Project Web App site
    
## Configure SQL Server and Analysis Services

Configuring SQL Server and Analysis Services includes the following steps:
  
- Configure SQL Server network settings
    
- Configure Analysis Services
    
## Install SharePoint Server 2013

Project Server 2013 requires SharePoint Server 2013 Enterprise Edition. Before you can install and configure Project Server 2013, you must install SharePoint Server 2013 and create a server farm. This article guides you to the proper SharePoint Server 2013 resources to configure your server farm.
  
## Install and configure Project Server 2013

Once you have set up a SharePoint Server 2013 server farm, you can install Project Server 2013. The Project Server 2013 software must be installed on each application server and front-end web server in the farm. Once the Project Server 2013 software is installed and configured, you must configure a Project Server service application in SharePoint Server 2013 before you can create an instance of Project Web App.
  
## Create a Project Web App site

Once the initial Project Server 2013 configuration within SharePoint Server 2013 is completed, you can configure an instance of Project Web App.
  
## Get started

The first step, prior to installation, is to make sure you have the needed permissions to accomplish the required tasks. For more information, see [Prepare for deployment](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/5eb36d04-7d13-4495-a00e-dfa28986223c.aspx).
