### To install prerequisites for SharePoint Server 2013

1. On the SharePoint Server DVD, run default.hta.
    
2. Click **Install software prerequisites**.

4. Read the license agreement, and if you accept, then select the **I accept the terms of the License Agreement(s)** check box.

    > Depending on your configuration, you may be required to restart the server during this process. 
  
Once the prerequisites have been installed, the next step is to install SharePoint Server 2013.
