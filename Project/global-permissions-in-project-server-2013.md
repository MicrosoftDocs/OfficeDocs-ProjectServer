|New Project  <br/> |Allows a user to add a new project to Project Server using Project Professional, Project Web App, or the Project Server Interface (PSI). New functionality in Project Server 2013 for this permission: If you do not also have the Open Project permission, after you create a project, you are taken back to the Project Center.  <br/> |||
|New Resource  <br/> |Allows a project manager to add new resources to the Enterprise Resource Pool using Project Professional, the Project Web App Resource Center, or the Project Server Interface (PSI). Grant this permission to any member of your organization who has to create new enterprise resources in Project Server.  <br/> > [!NOTE]> If your organization is using the Active Directory synchronization feature, you may want to consider denying this permission to all non-IT administrators in your organization.           |||

Users with this permission will also be able to use the Create a New Task link to create new tasks in Project Web App for any project to which the user has access.

A user who has the New Task Assignment permission must also have access to the projects to which they want to assign themselves to a task.  <br/> |||

|Reassign Task  <br/> |Allows a user to delegate an assigned task to another (existing) user. Grant this permission to members of your organization who need the ability to delegate task assignments to other resources. For example, a large project may be run by a single project manager, but actually implemented by several teams, each with its own team lead. A project manager could assign the team leads in the project plan, and then the team leads could in turn delegate each task to individual members of the teams. This example creates an additional layer of task management within the larger organization, but it can also simplify resource allocation within projects themselves and make it easier for a project manager to manage large projects. Or, if you have a resource that is about to leave on a three-week vacation, and this resource had this permission, that person would be able to assign his or her tasks directly to other resources instead of having the project manager check out the project and reassign resources.  <br/> |||
|Save Enterprise Global  <br/> |Allows a user to check out, modify, and save the Enterprise Global Template to the Project Server database from Project Professional.

|Save Unprotected Baseline  <br/> |Allows a user to save a non-protected baseline or clear a non-protected baseline associated with an enterprise project published to the Project Server database. Baselines are saved by using the Set Baseline functionality accessed from the Project Professional ribbon on the **Project** tab in the **Schedule** group. Click the **Set Baseline** button and then select **Save Baseline** or **Clear Baseline**. Unprotected Baselines are in the range of Baseline 6-10 inclusive.  <br/> |User needs to be granted the **Save Project** category permission. <br/> ||
|Self-Assign Team Tasks  <br/> |Resources can be members of a Team Assignment Pool. With this permission, it is possible for users to assign tasks, which have been assigned to their Team Assignment Pool, to themselves through the Team Tasks page in Project Web App.  <br/> |||
|Status Broker Permission  <br/> |Allows API updates to occur for a user from places like Exchange Server.  <br/> |||

|View Resource Availability  <br/> |Allows a user to access the View Resource Availability page to view resource allocation data in Project Web App. Grant this permission to users in your organization who need to view resource availability in Project Web App.  <br/> |||
|View Resource Center  <br/> |Allows users to access the Resource Center from Project Web App or Project Professional and view resource allocation data. Grant this permission to users who need to view the Resource Center in Project Web App by clicking the Resources link in the top-level navigation, or in Project Professional by selecting Resource Center on the Collaborate menu.  <br/> |User needs to be granted the **View Enterprise Resource Data** category permission. <br/> ||
|View Resource Plan  <br/> |Allows a user to access the Resource Plan page within Project Web App.  <br/> |||
|View Resource Timesheet  <br/> |Allows users to view the timesheets, regardless of their state or ownership, for resources identified in the category selection criteria.  <br/> |Users must be granted the **Accept Timesheet** global permission to use this permission. <br/> ||
|View Task Center  <br/> |This permission when denied prevents users from seeing the Task Center link on the Project Web App Quick Launch menu  <br/> > [!NOTE]> This permission does not lock down access to the Task Center page. It is still possible for users to navigate to this page.           |||
|View Team Builder  <br/> |Allows a user to use Build Team in Project Web App and Project Professional, as well as determine the list of available resources. Grant this permission to resource managers to allow them to use Build Team in Project Web App to add resources to projects that have been saved to the Project Server database. Project Managers can also use this permission to allow them to use Build Team in Project Professional to add resources to projects.  <br/> | User needs to be granted the **Assign Resources** category permission in addition to the **View Team Builder** global permission. The Assign Resources category permission determines the list of resources available in Build Team in both Project Professional and Project Web App. <br/>  User needs to be granted the **Build Team on Project** category permission. The Build Team on Project permission determines with which projects Build Team can be used. This applies to using Build Team in both Project Professional and Project Web App. <br/> ||
|View Timesheets  <br/> |When this permission is denied, it prevents users from seeing the Timesheet Center link on the Project Web App Quick Launch menu.  <br/> > [!NOTE]> This permission does not lock down access to the Timesheet page. It is still possible for users to navigate to this page.           |||
