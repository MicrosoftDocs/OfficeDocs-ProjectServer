# Install SharePoint Server 2016 (Project Server 2016)
 
 **Summary:** Install SharePoint Server 2016 and create a server farm prior to installing Project Server 2016.
  
Before you can configure Project Server 2016, you must [install SharePoint Server 2016](install-sharepoint-server-2016-project-server-2016.md) and create a SharePoint Server 2016 farm.
