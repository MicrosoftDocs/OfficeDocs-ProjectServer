# Plan for administrative and service accounts in Project Server 2013
 
 **Summary:** Learn about the accounts that you must plan for and the deployment scenarios that affect account requirements in Project Server 2013.<br/>
**Applies to:** Project Server 2013
  
Use this article to plan for the account requirements and recommendations for accounts that are required to install, configure, and use Project Server 2013.
  
You must provide credentials for these accounts during Setup and configuration. This article does not discuss accounts that you do not have to configure or provide credentials for.
  
## Administrative and service accounts that are required by Project Server 2013

This section lists and describes the accounts that are required by Project Server 2013.
  
> [!NOTE]
> All Project Server 2013 and SharePoint Server 2013 service accounts must be granted interactive logon permissions for the computer where the service is running. By default, such permissions are normally granted when a new account is set up. However, you may have to make manual adjustments if your organization normally denies interactive logon permissions for service accounts. 
  
The following table describes the standard account requirements for Project Server 2013.
  
**Standard account requirements for Project Server 2013**
