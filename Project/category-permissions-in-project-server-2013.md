# Category permissions in Project Server 2013
 
 **Summary:** Project Server 2013 security categories have various permissions that allow or deny users the ability to do certain tasks with projects and resources.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Project Server 2013 environment must be in Project Permission Mode in order to view category permissions and other security settings. For more information about Project Permission Mode, see [Plan user access in Project Server](plan-user-access-in-project-server.md). 
  
The following tables contain descriptions of all category permissions for Project Server 2013. The category permission descriptions are provided in two tables (Project and Resources), because category permissions apply to either projects or resources that are associated to a specific category. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> For information about different default security categories and their associated category permissions, see [Default categories in Project Server 2013](default-categories-in-project-server-2013.md). For more information about security categories and how they are used in the Project Server 2013 security model, see [Plan groups, categories, and RBS in Project Server](plan-groups-categories-and-rbs-in-project-server.md). 
  
The table includes columns with the following information:
  
- **Description** Describes what the permission lets you do.
    
- **Dependencies** Lists any other permissions (global or category) or requirements to allow the permission to function.
    
- **New for Project Server 2013** Displays an **×** symbol if the permission is new for Project Server 2013.
