# Restore your Project Server 2010 farm databases for upgrade (Project Server 2013)
 
 **Summary:** Restore your Project Server 2010 databases to the SQL Server instance that is hosting your Project Server 2013 data.<br/>
**Applies to:** Project Server 2013
  
This is one of the required steps when you upgrade from Project Server 2010 to Project Server 2013 through the database-attach upgrade method.
  
After you have configured the Project Server 2013 destination environment, you can restore the backup copies of the Project Server 2010 databases on the SQL Server instance that you are using to host your Project Server 2013 databases. This requires you to have backup copies of your Project Server 2010 databases and the SharePoint content database used to host your Project Web App site data. For information about how to create backup copies of these databases, see [Create backup copies of your Project Server 2010 farm databases for upgrade (Project Server 2013)](./create-backup-copies-of-your-project-server-2010-farm-databases-for-upgrade-to-p.md). 
  
The Project Server 2010 databases that are required for upgrading to Project Server 2013 include the following:
  
- Project Server Draft
    
- Project Server Archived
    
- Project Server Published
    
- Project Server Reporting
    
- SharePoint content database that contains your Project Web App site data
    
The following sections describe how to restore the backup copies of these databases on the SQL Server instance that you are using to host your Project Server 2013 databases. These include procedures in each of the SQL Server versions that are supported for use with Project Server 2010:
  
- SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2008 R2
    
- SQL Server 2012
    
After you have restored the backup copies of the Project Server 2010 databases, you can upgrade the databases and the Project Web App site collection. For more information, see [Upgrade to Project Server 2013](upgrade-to-project-server-2013.md).
