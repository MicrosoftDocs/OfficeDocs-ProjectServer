# Installation and deployment overview for Project Server 2016
 
 **Summary:** Learn about the steps involved in installing Project Server 2016.
  
This series of articles describes the steps necessary to install Project Server 2016. These steps include the following:
  
- Install SharePoint Server 2016
    
- Create a Project Web App site
    
## Install SharePoint Server 2016

Project Server 2016 is part of SharePoint Server 2016 Enterprise Edition. Before you can configure Project Web App, you must [install SharePoint Server 2016](install-sharepoint-server-2016-project-server-2016.md). 
  
## Install and configure Project Server 2016

Unlike prior versions of Project Server, Project Server 2016 does not require a separate install from SharePoint Server 2016. Once you have installed SharePoint Server 2016, you can [configure the Project Server service application ](install-and-configure-project-server-2016.md)and create a Project Web App site.
  
## Create a Project Web App site

Once the initial Project Server 2016 configuration within SharePoint Server 2016 is completed, you can [create a Project Web App site](deploy-project-web-app.md).
  
## Project Server forums and documentation feedback

If you have additional questions, try the [Project forums](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/category/project). The Project forums give you the chance to have your question discussed by other participants, Project MVPs, and Project community experts.
