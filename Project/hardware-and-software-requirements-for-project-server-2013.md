## Hardware requirements for Project Server 2013
<a name="section1"> </a>

When you plan for the hardware that is required for a Project Server 2013 deployment, as a starting point, you should determine the usage requirements for your Project Server 2013 environment. These variables include the number of projects, tasks, users, average tasks per project, and so on. By using the [How datasets affect performance and capacity in Project Server 2013](how-datasets-affect-performance-and-capacity-in-project-server-2013.md) tables, you can compare the numbers from your environment to the data for small, medium, and large datasets defined in their corresponding table. By selecting the dataset that most resembles the usage requirements in your environment, you can use the recommended topology and associated hardware requirements for your topology as a starting point when you plan for hardware for your Project Server 2013 deployment.
  
This section specifies the hardware requirements for a Project Server 2013 deployment based on the datasets defined in [How datasets affect performance and capacity in Project Server 2013](how-datasets-affect-performance-and-capacity-in-project-server-2013.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> The minimum hardware requirements in this section are recommended in which only the required services to run Project Server 2013 are enabled. Be aware that enabling additional SharePoint Server 2013 features in the farm may require more resources. For more information about hardware and software requirements for SharePoint Server 2013, see [Hardware and software requirements for SharePoint 2013](/SharePoint/install/hardware-and-software-requirements). 
  
### Small dataset hardware recommendations for Project Server 2013

The following are the recommended hardware requirements for a Project Server 2013 small dataset scenario. See [How datasets affect performance and capacity in Project Server 2013](how-datasets-affect-performance-and-capacity-in-project-server-2013.md) for more information about how the small dataset size is defined.
  
#### Minimum requirements for hardware for small datasets in Project Server 2013

The minimum hardware topology for a small dataset scenario is a single-server deployment that contains the following three tiers:
  
- SQL Server
    
- Application server
    
- Front-end web server
    
The minimum recommended hardware requirements for the servers in this dataset are as follows:
  
**Minimum hardware requirements for a small dataset in Project Server 2013**

|**Component**|**Minimum requirement**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Processor  <br/> |64-bit, four-core, 2.5 GHz minimum per core  <br/> |
|RAM  <br/> |24 GB for developer and evaluation use  <br/> |
|Hard disk  <br/> |80 GB for installation  <br/> For production use, you need additional free disk space for day-to-day operations. Add two times as much free space as you have RAM for production environments.  <br/> |
   
#### Recommended hardware for Project Server 2013 for a small dataset

Project Server 2013 runs as a service application on SharePoint Server 2013, and usage by other service applications generates additional resource usage (processor, RAM, and hard disk). While the minimum recommended requirements are suitable for a small dataset with light usage, more substantial datasets and usage patterns may require additional hardware resources. For a single-server deployment with a small dataset, we advise 16 GB of RAM to assure a high level of perceived performance.
  
We recommend that, if possible, you separate your SQL Server tier from the Application and front-end web tiers by placing your databases onto a dedicated computer that is running SQL Server.
  
- Server 1: Application and front-end web
    
- Server 2: SQL Server
    
For a two-tiered deployment supporting a small dataset, we recommend the following hardware requirements:
  
**Front-end web and Application server hardware recommendations for Project Server 2013**

|**Component**|**Minimum requirement**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Processor  <br/> |64-bit, four-core, 2.5 GHz minimum per core  <br/> |
|RAM  <br/> |8 GB for developer or evaluation use  <br/> 16 GB for production use  <br/> |
|Hard disk  <br/> |80 GB  <br/> |
   
**SQL Server hardware recommendations for Project Server 2013 for a small dataset**

|**Component**|**Minimum requirement**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Processor  <br/> |64-bit, four-core, 2.5 GHz minimum per core (If your dataset size is significantly larger than the medium dataset, we recommend 8 cores.)  <br/> |
|RAM  <br/> |16 GB  <br/> |
|Hard disk  <br/> |80 GB  <br/> |
   
### Medium dataset hardware recommendations for Project Server 2013

The following are the recommended hardware requirements for a Project Server 2013 medium dataset scenario. See [How datasets affect performance and capacity in Project Server 2013](how-datasets-affect-performance-and-capacity-in-project-server-2013.md) for more information about how the medium dataset size is defined.
  
#### Minimum requirements for hardware for medium datasets for Project Server 2013

The minimum recommended hardware topology for a medium dataset scenario is a three-tier deployment that contains a dedicated server for each of the following:
  
- Server 1: Front-end web server
    
- Server 2: Application server
    
- Server 3: SQL Server 
    
    
For a three-tier deployment supporting a medium dataset, the following are the hardware minimum requirements:
  
**Minimum hardware requirements for a Front-end web server for a medium dataset deployment of Project Server 2013**

|**Component**|**Minimum requirement**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Processor  <br/> |64-bit, four-core, 2.5 GHz minimum per core  <br/> |
|RAM  <br/> |8 GB for developer or evaluation use  <br/> 16 GB for single server and multiple server farm installation for production use  <br/> |
|Hard disk  <br/> |80 GB  <br/> |
   
**Minimum hardware requirements for an Application server for a medium dataset deployment of Project Server 2013**

|**Component**|**Minimum requirement**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Processor  <br/> |64-bit, four-core, 2.5 GHz minimum per core  <br/> |
|RAM  <br/> |8 GB for developer or evaluation use  <br/> 16 GB for single-server and multiple-server farm installation for production use  <br/> |
|Hard disk  <br/> |80 GB  <br/> |
   
**Minimum hardware requirements for the SQL Server tier for a medium dataset deployment of Project Server 2013**

|**Component**|**Minimum requirement**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Processor  <br/> |64-bit, four-core, 2.5 GHz minimum per core (If your dataset size is significantly larger than the medium dataset, we recommend 8 cores.)  <br/> |
|RAM  <br/> |16 GB  <br/> |
|Hard disk  <br/> |100 GB  <br/> |
   
#### Recommended hardware for Project Server 2013 for a medium dataset

As a general prescription, you should prepare to handle additional user load and data load by having sufficient computers to add more front-end web servers and Application servers to your topology. The hardware specifications of your front-end web servers and Application servers can remain largely the same. A 4x2x1 topology (four front-end web servers, two Application servers, and one computer that is running SQL Server) should be sufficient for handling the needs of most medium data sets and usage patterns. However, scaling out your Application and front-end web servers will add more load to the SQL Server tier, which you will have to compensate for by adding more memory and CPU resources. The following SQL Server specification should be able to handle the performance needs of most medium datasets.
  
**SQL Server hardware recommendations for Project Server 2013 for a medium dataset**

|**Component**|**Minimum requirement**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Processor  <br/> |64-bit, eight-core, 2.5 GHz minimum per core (If your dataset size is significantly larger than the medium dataset, we recommend 8 cores.)  <br/> |
|RAM  <br/> |32 GB  <br/> |
|Hard disk  <br/> |160 GB  <br/> NOTE - Ideally, you should separate and prioritize data among disks. Place your data files and your SQL Server transaction logs on separate physical hard disks. <br/> NOTE - RAID 5 should provide a good compromise between reliability, and throughput.           |
   
Additionally, if the SharePoint Server 2013 instance on which Project Server 2013 is coexisting with also experiences heavy usage (for example, you are not using the instance specifically for Project Server 2013 functionality), we recommend a separation of the ProjectService database and the SharePoint Server 2013SharePoint Server 2016 content databases. This requires you to place them on two dedicated computers that are running SQL Server.
  
### Large dataset hardware recommendations in Project Server 2013

The following are the recommended hardware requirements for a Project Server 2013 large dataset scenario. See [How datasets affect performance and capacity in Project Server 2013](how-datasets-affect-performance-and-capacity-in-project-server-2013.md) for more information about how the large dataset size is defined.
  
For large datasets, data load is the biggest concern. At a minimum, for large datasets you will want a 4×2×1 topology. The hardware characteristics of the front-end web and Application servers can generally remain the same as those recommended for the small and medium datasets. However, because the SQL Server tier will be the bottleneck, you may find that this constrains your ability to scale out to additional front-end web and Application servers. If data load is the bottleneck, you may find that additional front-end web and Application servers do not produce an improvement in throughput. 
  
For a large data set, we recommend that you invest in additional resources on the SQL Server tier of your topology. You can "scale-up" your SQL Server by adding additional RAM, CPU and hard disk resources.
  
The following are the minimum and recommended specifications for the SQL Server tier of a large dataset topology. 
  
#### Minimum requirements for hardware for large datasets in Project Server 2013

**Minimum hardware requirements for the SQL Server tier for a large dataset deployment of Project Server 2013**

|**Component**|**Minimum requirement**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Processor |64-bit, four-core, 2.5 GHz minimum per core (If your dataset size is significantly larger than the medium dataset, we recommend 8 cores.)|
|RAM|32 GB |
|Hard disk|250 GB <br/> NOTE - Ideally, you should separate and prioritize data among disks. Place your data files and your SQL Server transaction logs on separate physical hard disks. <br/> NOTE - RAID 5 should provide a good compromise between reliability, and throughput.           |

|Workflow editing  <br/> | Requires both of the following: <br/>  SharePoint Designer 2013 <br/>  Microsoft Visio 2013 <br/> ||
   
## Client requirements for Project Server 2013
<a name="section8"> </a>

When you are planning system requirements for Project Server 2013, you must also consider hardware and software requirements for the client users who need to connect to the server. These client users include the following:
  
- Project Professional 2013 users
    
- Project Web App users
    
### Project Professional client compatibility with Project Server 2013

If you plan to upgrade from an earlier version of Project Server, you must consider whether your current Project Professional clients will be compatible with Project Server 2013.

  
|**Project Server version**|**Supported Project Professional version**|**Note**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Project Server 2016 <br/> | Project Professional 2019 Preview <br/> Project Professional 2016 <br/> Project Professional 2013 <br/> Project Online Desktop Client <br/> ||
|Project Server 2013 <br/> | Project Professional 2016 <br/> Project Professional 2013 <br/>  |Project Online Desktop Client connectivity to Project Server 2013 will expire and no longer be supported after January 13, 2020. <br/>|
|Project Server 2010 <br/>  | Project Professional 2010 <br/>  Office Project Professional 2007 with Service Pack 2 <br/>  |Project Professional 2007 with Service Pack 2 can only connect to Project Server 2010 when backward compatibility mode is enabled on the server.  <br/>|
|Project Server 2007  <br/> | Office Project Professional 2007 <br/> | |

   
Plan for these two considerations when planning for Project Professional client connectivity:
  
- Project Server 2013 does not provide a "backward compatibility" connectivity feature for any previous Project Professional client versions. 
    
- Project Professional 2013 does not connect to Project Server 2010.
