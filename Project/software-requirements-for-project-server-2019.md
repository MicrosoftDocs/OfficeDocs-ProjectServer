# Software requirements for Project Server 2019
 
**Summary:** Learn about installation requirements for Project Server 2019. 
**Applies to:** Project Server 2019 
  
## Key Requirements

In previous versions of Project Server, Project Server was installed separately after you installed SharePoint Server, as SharePoint Server was a requirement. Project Server 2019 installation is now a part of the SharePoint Server 2019 Enterprise installation process. The installation files for Project Server 2019 are included in the SharePoint Server 2019 Enterprise MSI file, and it is installed along with it. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Project Server 2019 can only be enabled on the Enterprise version of SharePoint Server 2019. You will not be able to enable Project Server 2019 on SharePoint Server 2019 with a Standard license. 
  
Since Project Server 2019 is part of the SharePoint Server 2019  installation, requirements for Project Server 2019 (including supported browsers, operating systems, and database servers) will be the ones specified for SharePoint Server 2019.
