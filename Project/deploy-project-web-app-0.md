# How to deploy Project Web App
 
 **Summary:** Learn about the two ways to deploy a Project Web App site.<br/>
**Applies to:** Project Server 2013
  
## Project Web App deployment options

There are two options for deploying Project Web App. You can either create a Project Web App site as the top level of a new site collection, or you can add a Project Web App site to an existing site collection.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you are upgrading from a previous version of Project Server, you will deploy Project Web App as part of the upgrade process. Read [Upgrade to Project Server 2013](upgrade-to-project-server-2013.md) instead.
  
If you are looking for a clean environment to begin managing projects in Project Web App, consider creating your Project Web App site as the top level site in a new site collection. (This was the only option available in Project Server 2010.) For step-by-step instructions on how to create a Project Web App site as the top level site in a new site collection, see [Deploy Project Web App with a new site collection (Project Server 2013)](deploy-project-web-app-with-a-new-site-collection-project-server-2013.md).
  
If you have existing sites where you have SharePoint task list projects and you want to add Project Server functionality to them, you can add a Project Web App site to that site collection. For step-by-step instructions on how to add a Project Web App site to an existing site collection, see [Deploy Project Web App in an existing site collection (Project Server 2013)](deploy-project-web-app-in-an-existing-site-collection-project-server-2013.md)
  
For more information about Project Web App site architecture, watch the chalk talk video in the next section.
