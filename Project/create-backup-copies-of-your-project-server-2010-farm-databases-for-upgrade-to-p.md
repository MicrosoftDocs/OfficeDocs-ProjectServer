# Create backup copies of your Project Server 2010 farm databases for upgrade to Project Server 2013
 
 **Summary:** Learn how to back up Project Server 2010 databases by using SQL Server 2005, SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2008 R2, or SQL Server 2012.<br/>
**Applies to:** Project Server 2013
  
Upgrading to Project Server 2013 requires you to use the database-attach upgrade method. This method upgrades your Project Server 2010 databases and merges them in a single Project Web App database. It also restores the Project Web App content database to your Project Server 2013 farm. One of the first steps in upgrading from Project Server 2010 to Project Server 2013 is to create backup copies of your databases that you will need to upgrade from your Project Server 2010 farm deployment. These databases include the following:
  
- Project Server Draft
    
- Project Server Archived
    
- Project Server Published
    
- Project Server Reporting
    
- SharePoint content database (which contains your Project Web App site data)
    
The following sections describe how to create backup copies of these databases in SQL Server. These include procedures in each of the SQL Server versions that are supported for use with Project Server 2010:
  
- SQL Server 2005
    
- SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2008 R2
    
- SQL Server 2012
    
After you complete this procedure, you will have to restore your backup copies of your databases to the SQL Server instance that you are using to host your Project Server 2013 databases. For more information, see [Restore your Project Server 2010 farm databases for upgrade (Project Server 2013)](./restore-your-project-server-2010-farm-databases-for-upgrade-project-server-2013.md).
  
## Create backup copies of your databases in SQL Server 2005

### To back up a database in SQL Server 2005

1. On the database server, click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 2005**, and then click **SQL Server Management Studio**.
    
2. In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, fill in the connection information, and then click **Connect**.
    
3. After you connect to the appropriate instance of the SQL Server 2005 Database Engine, in Object Explorer, expand the server tree by expanding the server name.
    
4. Expand **Databases**, right-click the database that you want to back up, point to **Tasks**, and then click **Back Up**. The **Back Up Database** dialog box appears.
    
5. In the **Source** section, in the **Database** box, verify the database name.
    
6. In the **Backup type** box, select **Full**.
    
7. For the **Backup component**, select **Database**.
    
8. In the **Backup set** section, in the **Name** box, either accept the default backup set name that is suggested or type a different name for the backup set.
    
9. In the **Destination** section, specify the type of backup destination by selecting **Disk** or **Tape**, and then specify a destination. To create a different destination, click **Add**.
    
10. Click **OK** to start the backup process.
    
Repeat the previous procedure to back up the remaining required databases.
