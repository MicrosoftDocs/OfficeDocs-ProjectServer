|![Sign up](media/094f4fe5-6b9c-41b7-8b5b-431c09684d05.png)           <br/> |**Start from scratch** <br/> New to Office 365? Start here!  <br/> [![Sign up for Project Online](media/3c86592e-8704-4428-8b62-bf52c1dcfa03.png)](https://products.office.com/Project/project-online-portfolio-management)|**Add Project Online to Office 365** <br/> If you already have an Office 365 account, you may be able to add Project Online to that account by choosing **Activate offers** from the left menu on the Microsoft 365 admin center under **Billing**.

|![Add user](media/adf53af3-c248-4fd8-95fd-26c2a7cdb3e4.png)           <br/> | It may seem a little backwards, but after you sign up, the first thing you should do is **make sure your account is assigned a Project Online license**. Some accounts are and some aren't.  <br/> **To check if you're assigned a license:** <br/>  Choose **Users** \> **Active Users** from the left menu on the Microsoft 365 admin center.  <br/>  Choose your account.  <br/>  Confirm that the **Project Online** is listed under **Product licenses**.  <br/> **Even if, as the administrator, you don't actually plan to use Project Online,** the only way you'll be able to see that Project Online is, in fact, included in your Office 365 account is by giving yourself a license to use it. You can go back in later and remove your license to free it up for another user, if needed.  <br/> |
   
## Be patient...

|![Wait](media/f40769cb-3996-47ca-9cff-09edcde83171.png)           <br/> |It takes a while for Project Online to finish getting set up. Go have a cup of coffee or catch up on email. **Setup will generally be done within 30 minutes to an hour**, but it can sometimes take longer (or shorter!). Don't panic if yours is taking longer!  <br/> When you come back to check on setup, refresh the page. If you see **Project** listed in the app launcher , you're ready to go!  <br/> > [!TIP]>  Need more than one Project Online site?
