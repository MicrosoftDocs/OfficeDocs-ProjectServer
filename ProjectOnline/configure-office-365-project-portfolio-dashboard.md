The Office 365 Project Portfolio Dashboard app provides a variety of project, task, and resource-based reports, including issues/risks/deliverables reporting for Project Online. You can download it from the SharePoint Store for free.

2. On the Your Apps page, in the left navigation, click **SharePoint Store**.
    
3. In the SharePoint Store, search for Office 365 Project Portfolio Dashboard.
    
4. Click **Add It**, and then click **Continue**.
    
5. Make sure the **Add this app to Project Web App** check box is selected, and then click **Return to site**.
    
6. Click **Trust It**.
    
In order for users to be able to access the Portfolio Dashboard, they must be members of one of the following [SharePoint groups in Project Web App](plan-sharepoint-groups-in-project-online.md):
  
- Administrators for Project Web App
    
- Portfolio Managers for Project Web App
    
- Portfolio Viewers for Project Web App
    
Note that even if you're using Project Permission Mode, you still need to add users to these SharePoint groups. Project Permission Mode security groups cannot be used to grant access to Office 365 Project Portfolio Dashboard.
