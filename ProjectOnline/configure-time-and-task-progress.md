# Configure time and task progress

There are several ways you can set up time and task progress for your organization in Project Web App.
  
1. **First, decide [how task progress should be captured](set-up-how-time-and-task-progress-are-captured.md) in your organization.** Do you want it reported in a timesheet, along with the hours a team member has completed, or do you want it split out? 
    
2. **Next, consider different ways you might [customize timesheets and task progress](customize-timesheets-and-task-progress-for-your-organization.md).** Every organization does things differently, and there are several settings that let you control what gets reported. 
    
3. **Figure out [how you want approval to work](set-up-time-and-task-progress-approval.md).** Is the project manager the only person who needs to approve things? Or are more people involved, like a resource manager or a payroll specialist? 
    
4. **Refine your settings by [enforcing other policies](set-up-policies-for-capturing-time-and-task-progress.md).** Generally it's good to keep things simple, but sometimes you just can't avoid complexity (especially when timesheets are involved!).
