# Delete a Project Web App site

  
After you subscribed to Project Online, you may have created a couple of different Project Web App sites to try things out before rolling it out to the rest of your team. When you're ready, you can delete an unused Project Web App site.
  
1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account. 
    
2. Go to the SharePoint admin center.
    
3. Point to the Project Web App site that you are deleting, and then select the check box to the left of the URL.
    
4. On the ribbon, in the **Contribute** group, select **Delete**.
    
5. Select **Delete** to move the site collection to the Recycle Bin. 
    
The site collection stays in the Recycle Bin for 30 days, and then is permanently deleted. During the 30 days when it is in the Recycle Bin, you can [Restore a deleted site collection](https://support.office.com/article/91c18651-c017-47d1-9c27-3a22f325d6f1#__toc315681383) at any time, and the Project Web App database is also restored. 
  
## Make room for a new Project Web App site

 Project Online allows you to have seven site collections with Project Web App. If you have seven sites, and you delete one using the steps above, Project Online will continue to count the deleted site as one of your seven sites until it is permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin in 30 days. 
  
If you would rather not wait 30 days to free up a Project Web App site, you can disable Project Web App on a site collection.

 **Disabling Project Web App is not reversible,** so be sure that you will never need to restore the Project Web App site that you are disabling. Once Project Web App is disabled, the database with all of your project information is permanently deleted. 
  
1. Sign in to Office 365 with your work or school account. 
    
2. Go to the SharePoint admin center.
    
3. Point to the Project Web App site that you are deleting, and then select the check box to the left of the URL.
    
4. On the ribbon, in the **Manage** group, select **Project Web App** \> **Remove**.
    
    ![On the ribbon, click Project Web App, and then click Remove.](media/84a70d62-5c72-4afb-aa7e-2c4ee6fa6929.png)
  
5. Select **Disable**.
    
After you disable Project Web App, you don't have to delete the site collection. When you are at your seven-site limit, disabling Project Web App is enough to make it so that you can create a new Project Web App site.
