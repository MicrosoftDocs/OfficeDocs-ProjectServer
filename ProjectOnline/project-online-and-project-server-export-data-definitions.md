# Project Online and Project Server export data definitions

This technical reference article describes the data objects and properties contained in the output files you receive when using the user data export method described in [Export user data from Project Online](export-user-data-from-project-online.md) and in [Export user data from Project Server](/project/export-user-data-from-project-server) . This article will include short descriptions of the objects and properties you will find in the output data. 
  
We can group the user data output your receive from both Project Online and Project Server into the following:
  
- [Project lists](project-online-and-project-server-export-data-definitions.md#project-lists): A list of projects that the user was a part of in the Project Web App (PWA) site.
    
- [Feature-specific data](project-online-and-project-server-export-data-definitions.md#featurespec): Feature in the PWA site in which the user might have data.
    
- [Project-specific user data from the reporting data](project-online-and-project-server-export-data-definitions.md#projectspec): Detailed data about a user's project in the PWA site.
    
- [Project-specific Metadata files](project-online-and-project-server-export-data-definitions.md#ProjSpecMeta): Project metadata about a user's project in the PWA site.
    
## Project lists


You will receive three lists of projects contained in the Project Draft, Published, and Reporting schemas. All the projects in the lists were projects the user was a part of. This means the user was involved in the project as at least one of the following:
  
- Was the project owner.
    
- Has a task assigned to him or her in the project.
    
- Is an assignment owner of a task in the project.
    
- Is the status manager of a task in the project.
    
This data includes:
  
- List of projects from the Draft schema that corresponds to the conditions above.
- List of projects from the Published schema that corresponds to the conditions above.
- List of projects from the Reporting schema that corresponds to the conditions above. 
   
The list of projects may differ slightly for each of the three files. For example, a user can save the project and not publish, meaning that it will appear in the Draft projects list, but not the Published or Reporting projects lists.
  
A project admin can use the Project list files to give them information about which project-specific export files they may be interested in analyzing to decide how much of the exported content should be shared with the user.
  
All three of the ProjectList files will have the following properties for each project listed:
  
| Property | Description |
|:-----|:-----|
|SiteId  <br/> |The unique identifier for the PWA site in which the project exists.  <br/> |
|Proj_UID  <br/> |The unique identifier for the project.  <br/> |
|Proj_Name  <br/> |Name of the project.  <br/> |
   
## Feature-specific data
<a name="featurespec"> </a>

The export method defined in [Export user data from Project Online](export-user-data-from-project-online.md) creates the following feature-related .json files that checks for a specific user's data in features used in Project Online. If no data is found for the user in that feature, the corresponding .json file will be empty. 
  
The export method defined in [Export user data from Project Server](/project/export-user-data-from-project-server) queries for feature-related data through SQL scripts run against the Project Server databases. 
  
The feature areas for both Project Online and Project Server include the following. Click on the feature name in the table to see brief definitions of the objects and properties you may see in the data you export data you receive about the user.

#### UserViewSettings for Project Server 2010
<a name="UserView2010"> </a>

> [!NOTE]
> This section include information about UserViewSettings data in Project Server 2010. For information about Project Server 2016, Project Server 2013, or Project Online, see the previous section ([UserViewSettings](project-online-and-project-server-export-data-definitions.md#UserProp)). 
  
UserViewSettings contains data about custom view settings that the user created. Objects can have the following properties:
  

| Property | Description |
|:-----|:-----|
|PropertyName  <br/> |Name of the property.  <br/> |
|PropertyValue  <br/> |Value of the property.  <br/> |
   
The custom view objects include the following:
  
- **WebControlSettings**: These are user settings for web controls in different pages. These web controls include the following: 
    
| Name | Web Control |
|:-----|:-----|
|teambuilderhometab  <br/> |Team Builder  <br/> |
|teambuilderjsgridcontrol  <br/> |Team Builder  <br/> |
|effectiverightsgrid  <br/> |Effective Rights  <br/> |
|eptjsgridcontrol  <br/> |Enterprise Project Types  <br/> |
|projectcenterjsgridcontrol  <br/> |Project Center  <br/> |
|projectdrilldownjsgridcontrol  <br/> |Schedule Page  <br/> |
|resourceassignmentsjsgridcontrol  <br/> |Resource Assignments  <br/> |
|resourcecenterjsgridcontrol  <br/> |Resource Center  <br/> |
|resourcerequestsjsgridcontrol  <br/> |Resource Requests  <br/> |
|reviewtsdetailpartjsgridcontrol  <br/> |Review Timesheet  <br/> |
|selecttasksfortlgrid  <br/> |Select tasks for Timeline  <br/> |
|statusapprovalshistorypage  <br/> |Status Approval History  <br/> |
|approvalcenterjsgridcontrol  <br/> |Approvals  <br/> |
|statusapprovalspreviewjsgridcontrol  <br/> |Status Approvals Review  <br/> |
|mytasksjsgridcontrol  <br/> |My Tasks  <br/> |
|teamtasksjsgridcontrol  <br/> |Team Assignments  <br/> |
|timesheetpartjsgridcontrol  <br/> |Timesheets  <br/> |
   
   In the export data for Project Server 2010, WebControlSettings data will display the name of the web control after the actual property for the control. For example, the following is a **Date** property for the **MyTasksJSGridControl**, which has a value of **1**. 
    
  ```
   	{
   	        "PropertyName":  "DateMyTasksJSGridControl",
   	        "PropertyValue":  "1"
   	    },
  
  ```

- **WebControlResourcePlanEngagementSettings:**: These are user settings for web controls in the resource plan engagement pages. If the PropertyName contains ResPlanGrid or ProjectEngagementsGrid, then the GUID in the PropertyName is the Project Unique Identifier (PROJ_UID). You can retrieve the corresponding project name from the MSP_PROJECTS table in the Project Server 2010 Published database. 
    
- **ViewSettings**: These are user settings in different views across the product. If the PropertyName looks like it contains just one GUID, then that GUID is the View Identifier (WVIEW_UID) from the MSP_WEB_VIEW_REPORTS table in the Project Server 2010 Published database, and the corresponding view name is stored in the WVIEW_NAME. 
    
    The actual property name will display before the GUID value.
    
    In the following example, the View unique identifier is  *000010fc-7b06-45a9-9bd2-1cbfc2f64ce4*  and the property name is  *DividerPosition*  . 
    
  ```
   	{
   	        "PropertyName":  "DividerPosition000010fc-7b06-45a9-9bd2-1cbfc2f64ce4",
   	        "PropertyValue":  "0"
   	    },
  
  ```

- **LastPDPViewed**: This provides information about the last Project Detail Page that was viewed for a particular project. The unique identifier of the corresponding project (PROJ_UID) is displayed after the string  *PDPPages_LastViewed_PDP_For*  . Also, the project name (PROJ_NAME) can be obtained from the MSP_PROJECTS table in the Project Server 2010 Published database. In the following example, the project has a unique identifier of  *051f3a1e-02f5-4e45-bea7-30bfbf8df67f*  , and the last viewed Project Detail Page has unique identifier  *1e26f08d-2757-46d9-b726-16cae3614c56*  . You could find the project name by checking the MSP_PROJECTS table for the PROJ_NAME associated with  *051f3a1e-02f5-4e45-bea7-30bfbf8df67f.* 
    
  ```
   	{
   	        "PropertyName":  "PDPPages_LastViewed_PDP_For_051f3a1e-02f5-4e45-bea7-30bfbf8df67f",
   	        "PropertyValue":  "1e26f08d-2757-46d9-b726-16cae3614c56"
   	    },
  
  ```

- **OptimizerPlannerPlannerReqPages**: This provides settings the user customized on the Optimizer, Planner and Planner Request pages. If the PropertyName contains  *{Optimizer}*  ,  *{Planner*  } or  *{PlannerReq}*  , two unique identifiers will follow it. The first is the unique identifier of the view, and the second is the unique identifier for the analysis. You can find the corresponding view name (WVIEW_NAME) in the MSP_WEB_VIEW_REPORTS table from the view id (WVIEW_UID) in the Project Server 2010 Published database. The corresponding analysis name (ANALYSIS_NAME) can be obtained from the MSP_ANALYSIS table from the view ID(ANALYSIS_UID) column in the Project Server 2010 Published database. 
    
- **PlannerDefPlannerResPlannerAvailPages**: This provides settings the user customized on the Planner Deficit, Planner Resource, Planner Availability pages. If the PropertyName contains  *{PlannerDef}*  ,  *{PlannerRes}*  or  *{PlannerAvail}*  , then the GUID that follows it is the unique identifier of the analysis. The corresponding analysis name (ANALYSIS_NAME) can be obtained from the MSP_ANALYSIS table from the view ID (ANALYSIS_UID) in the Project Server 2010 Published database.
