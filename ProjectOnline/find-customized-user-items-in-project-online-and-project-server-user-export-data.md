# Find customized user items in Project Online and Project Server user export data

This article describes how to search for a specific users customized items (views, filters, attachments, tables, and macros) in a project when you do an export of the users data in Project Online or Project Server. This includes: 
  
- [To find and save customized views](find-customized-user-items-in-project-online-and-project-server-user-export-data.md#Custviews)
    
- [To find and save customized filters](find-customized-user-items-in-project-online-and-project-server-user-export-data.md#CustFilt)
    
- [To find and save attachments](find-customized-user-items-in-project-online-and-project-server-user-export-data.md#Attach)
    
- [To find and save customized tables](find-customized-user-items-in-project-online-and-project-server-user-export-data.md#About)
    
- [To find and save user macros](find-customized-user-items-in-project-online-and-project-server-user-export-data.md#Macros)
    
The procedures in this article require you to have the following:
  
- The MPP file for the project
    
- The XML file for the project
    
For Project Online, both files were provided to you when you exported the user data through the procedures in [Export user data from Project Online](export-user-data-from-project-online.md).
  
For Project Server, you will need to save the specific project file to XML format to create the XML file.
  
> [!NOTE]
> When saving a project file to XML format with Project Professional, make sure that you have applied the latest updates. 
  
## To find and save customized views
<a name="Custviews"> </a>

1. Open the specific project's XML file in a text editor.
    
2. In the text, search for **\<Views\>** to find a list of user views for the project. 
    
3. In the list of Views, look for any views that have the **IsCustomized** property set to **true**. For example, the following means a View named Active Tasks has been customized from the global/default template: 
    
  ```
  <View>
  <Name>Task Sheet</Name>
  <IsCustomized>true</IsCustomized>
  </View>
  
  ```

4. Now open the project's MPP file in the Project Online Desktop Client or Project Professional 2016. 
    
5. Click the **View** menu to open the ribbon, and in the ribbon select the **Other View** dropdown menu, and then click **More Views**.
