# Add Project Online to a site collection

   
Adding Project Online to an existing site collection helps you use the permissions and users that you have already set up. It also lets you bring SharePoint tasks into Project Online, and share your enterprise projects on your team or project site.
  
> [!TIP]
> To learn more about using SharePoint and Project Online together, take a look at [Overview: View a SharePoint task list in Project Web App](https://support.office.com/article/720757ef-545c-4635-98f9-c231d662561b). 
  
To enable Project Online on an existing site collection:
  
1. Log on to the Microsoft Office 365 portal site.
    
    Tip If you're not sure of your User ID, refer to the 'Get Started with Microsoft Office 365' email message that includes your User ID and other account information.
    
2. Click the app launcher ![The app launcher icon in Office 365.](media/7502f4ec-3c9a-435d-a7b4-b9cda85189a7.png), and then click **Admin**.
