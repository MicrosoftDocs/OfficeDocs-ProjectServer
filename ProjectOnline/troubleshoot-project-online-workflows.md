# Troubleshoot Project Online workflows

It is common as a Project Web App admin to have to troubleshoot Project workflows. Depending on how the workflow process has been defined for the organization, there may be instances where an admin needs to act for the workflow instance to progress. There are fields that a user can add to the Project Center, query OData or the Project Online Rest endpoint to better understand the state of each Project workflow. With the information provided in these fields, a Project Web App admin can take the appropriate corrective action to unblock the progression of the Project workflow.
  
There are three steps on troubleshooting Project Online workflows:
  
1. [Setting up views and reports to see the errors](troubleshoot-project-online-workflows.md#settingupviews)
    
2. [Reviewing the errors](troubleshoot-project-online-workflows.md#reverrors)
    
3. [Acting on the errors and taking additional steps](troubleshoot-project-online-workflows.md#ActingonErrors)
    
## Setting up views and reports to see the errors
<a name="settingupviews"> </a>

An admin can see Project workflow errors in two ways:
  
- Create a Project Center View to see workflow state
    
- Query Project OData Service or the Project REST API
    
### Create a Project Center View to see workflow state

We recommend creating a new Project Center view to troubleshoot Project workflows. To create the view or edit a Project Center view, the user will need to have the Global permission to Manage Project Web App Views
  
> [!NOTE]
> For more information on how to manage security, please see [Video series: How security permissions work in Project Server](https://support.office.com/article/a19fb429-4f8f-4aa1-a186-8a33650c9801)
  
 **To create the view**
  
1. From Project Web App, click on the gear icon then ** PWA Settings **.
    
2. On the settings page, click **Manage Views**. A list of views will appear.
    
3. Click ** New View **.
    
4. In the Name and Type section, in the ** View Type ** list, select **Project Center**.
    
5. In the **Name** box, type the name of the new view. For example, "  *Project Workflows*  ". 
    
6. In the **Description** box, type a description of the new view. 
    
7. In the **Table and Fields** section, from the **Displayed Fields** list, remove the default **Start and Finish** fields. Add the following fields from the **Available fields** list: 
    
  - Workflow Error Code
    
  - Workflow Error
    
  - Workflow Created
    
  - Workflow ID
    
  - Workflow Last Run
    
  - Workflow Owner
    
  - Workflow Phase Name
    
  - Workflow Stage Name
    
  - Workflow State
    
  - Checked Out
    
  - Checked Out By﻿
    
8. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Filter﻿﻿**. 
    
9. Add the filter using the field " **Workflow Error Code**is greater than 1" and click **OK** ﻿. 
    
10. Click **Save**.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > After clicking **Save**, you will receive the following message: " *You have not assigned a security category to this view. Failure to do so will prevent anyone from seeing the view in the dropdown or from using the view. Do you want to save anyway?*  " Click **OK**, because only members of the PWA Administrators group will be able to view the Project Workflows Project Center view. 
  
### Query Project OData Service or the Project REST API

Optionally users can query for this information from the Project OData Service or programmatically through the Project REST API.
  
Project OData Service
  
|**Project Center Field**|**Entity**|**Property**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Workflow Error Code  <br/> |Projects  <br/> |WorkflowErrorResponseCode  <br/> |
|Workflow Error  <br/> |Projects  <br/> |WorkflowError  <br/> |
|Workflow Created  <br/> |Projects  <br/> |WorkflowCreatedDate  <br/> |
|Workflow ID  <br/> |Projects  <br/> |WorkflowInstanceId  <br/> |
|Workflow Last Run  <br/> |ProjectWorkflowStageData  <br/> |StageLastSubmittedDate  <br/> |
|Workflow Owner  <br/> |Projects  <br/> |WorkflowOwnerName  <br/> |
|Workflow Phase Name  <br/> |ProjectWorkflowStageData  <br/> |PhaseName  <br/> |
|Workflow Stage Name  <br/> |ProjectWorkflowStageData  <br/> |StageName  <br/> |
|Workflow State  <br/> |ProjectWorkflowStageData  <br/> |StageStatus  <br/> |
   
> [!NOTE]
> For more information about the Project OData service, see [ProjectData-Project OData service reference](/previous-versions/office/project-odata/jj163015(v=office.15)). 
  
Project REST API
  
|**Project Center Field**|**Entity**|**Property**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Workflow Error Code  <br/> |ProjectWorkflowInstance  <br/> |WorkflowErrorResponseCode  <br/> |
|Workflow Error  <br/> |ProjectWorkflowInstance  <br/> |WorkflowError  <br/> |
|Workflow Created  <br/> |ProjectWorkflowInstance  <br/> |WorkflowCreatedDate  <br/> |
|Workflow ID  <br/> |ProjectWorkflowInstance  <br/> |Id  <br/> |
|Workflow Last Run  <br/> |ProjectWorkflowInstance  <br/> |LastSubmittedDate  <br/> |
|Workflow Owner  <br/> |Projects  <br/> |ProjectOwnerName  <br/> |
|Workflow Phase Name  <br/> |ProjectWorkflowStageData  <br/> |PhaseName  <br/> |
|Workflow Stage Name  <br/> |ProjectWorkflowStageData  <br/> |StageName  <br/> |
|Workflow State  <br/> |ProjectWorkflowInstance  <br/> |WorkflowState  <br/> |
   
### Code Examples

Read a filtered set of projects and retrieve the project workflow instances. If the request includes more then 20 projects, you will need to add additional filtering otherwise the request will fail:
  
```
GET https://CONTOSO.sharepoint.com/teams/project/PWA/_api/projectserver/projects?$Filter=startswith(Name,'Budget')&amp;$Expand=ProjectWorkflowInstance,ProjectWorkflowInstance/WorkflowInstance
```

Read all workflows with error response codes greater than or equal to 400, including the owner and minimal details about the project:
  
```
GET https://CONTOSO.sharepoint.com/teams/project/PWA/_api/projectserver/projectworkflowinstances?$FILTER=WorkflowErrorResponseCode ge 400&amp;$SELECT=Id,WorkflowError,WorkflowErrorResponseCode,WorkflowState,Project/Id,Project/Name&amp;$EXPAND=WorkflowInstanceOwner,Project
```

## Reviewing the errors
<a name="reverrors"> </a>

If the admin created a Project Center view as described above, the view can be accessed following these steps:
  
1. From Project Web App, navigate to Project center by clicking **Projects** from the Quick Launch. 
    
2. Click on **Projects** in the ribbon. 
    
3. Select the view that was created following the steps above from the **View:** dropdown. 
    
    This will provide the user with a list of all the projects and the current status of each project's workflow, including errors.
    
Optionally the user can review the errors through a custom report or programmatically as described above.
  
> [!NOTE]
> The Workflow Created and Workflow Last Run display date and time in UTC. ﻿ 
  
> [!NOTE]
> After acting on the errors it will take up to 24 hours for the status to be updated in Project Center, Project Service OData and through the Project REST AP. 
  
## Acting on the errors and taking additional steps
<a name="ActingonErrors"> </a>

The following errors may happen with a Project workflow:
  
|**Error**|**Action**|
|:-----|:-----|
|We were not able to update the status for project PROJECT_GUID  <br/> |Typically this error will be resolved if no action is taken for a period of time. If you need the error to be resolved immediately, try [How to Resume a SharePoint Workflow](troubleshoot-project-online-workflows.md#resumeSPWF).  <br/> |
|We were not able to update the status for stage STAGE_GUID on project PROJECT_GUID  <br/> |Typically this error will be resolved if no action is taken for a period of time. If you need the error to be resolved immediately, try [How to Resume a SharePoint Workflow](troubleshoot-project-online-workflows.md#resumeSPWF).  <br/> |
|Stage STAGE_GUID is not the current stage for project PROJECT_GUID  <br/> |This error happens when attempting to set workflow stage status for a workflow stage that is not in valid. In this situation, you need to [How to Restart a Project Workflow](troubleshoot-project-online-workflows.md#restartSPWF).  <br/> |
|Custom field CUSTOM_FIELD_GUID does not have a value set for project PROJECT_GUID  <br/> |A custom field is not correctly set and the workflow is unable to progress until the custom field value is updated. To determine the name of the custom field that needs to be updated, see the section titled [How to get a Custom Field from a Custom Field GUID](troubleshoot-project-online-workflows.md#custfieldGuid). After updating the custom field, try [How to Resume a SharePoint Workflow](troubleshoot-project-online-workflows.md#resumeSPWF).  <br/> > [!NOTE]> As a best practice, it is recommended for true/false custom fields involved in a workflow to use a lookup table opposed to a flag custom field to prevent this issue for custom fields of this type.           |
|The custom field CUSTOM_FIELD_GUID does not exist.  <br/> |This happens when the workflow attempts to read or write the value for a custom field which has been removed from PWA. You will need to edit the workflow and ensure proper custom field is associated with the workflow.  <br/> |
|Failure submitting Check-in job for project PROJECT_GUID  <br/> |Typically this error will be resolved if no action is taken for a period of time. If you need the error to be resolved immediately, try [How to Resume a SharePoint Workflow](troubleshoot-project-online-workflows.md#resumeSPWF). If the issue continues to persist, you will need to [How to Restart a Project Workflow](troubleshoot-project-online-workflows.md#restartSPWF).  <br/> |
