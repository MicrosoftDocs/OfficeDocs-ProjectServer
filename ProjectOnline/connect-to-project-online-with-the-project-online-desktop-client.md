# Connect to Project Online with the Project Online Desktop Client

The Project Online Desktop client is included with your Project Online Professional or Project Online Premium license.  While you can use it as a standalone client to create and manage your project plans offline, you can also use it to connect to Project Online in your Office 365 environment to work with your Project Online users. For example, you can create, save, and publish your projects to Project Online, and team members assigned to your project tasks can use Project Online to give you updates on their task status.
