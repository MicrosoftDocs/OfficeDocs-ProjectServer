# Add a custom column to a table in Project for the web

When you need all the projects created in your Dataverse environment to accommodate a new piece of information, add a column to the appropriate table in Project Power App. If possible, [use an available built-in column](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/add-move-or-delete-fields-on-form#create-a-new-column-on-the-table-when-editing-a-form). This article provides steps to add a column that isn't built-in: a custom column.
