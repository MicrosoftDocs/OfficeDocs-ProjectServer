title: Customize the Project Management Office Accelerator
description: The PMO Accelerator adds support for various scenarios to Project for the web. You can customize it  by creating a managed solution. Keeping your customizations in a separate solution lets you preserve the PMO Accelerator solution, so you can deploy updated versions as they are released.

# Customize the Project Management Office Accelerator

After you [deploy the PMO Accelerator](deploy-project-for-web-accelerator-power-bi-template.md), consider creating a custom managed solution to add any extra functionality you want. The [Power BI template](deploy-power-bi-template-project-for-web-accelerator.md) is a great example: it adds significant reporting features to the PMO Accelerator, but merely deploying the template won't integrate the reports&mdash;you need to change some components to enable it, and a managed solution that you deploy on top of the Accelerator is the best way to make such changes.

## Prerequisites

- Admin rights in a development environment [with the Project Management Office Accelerator deployed](deploy-project-for-web-accelerator-power-bi-template.md)
- Rights to use the Common Data Service connector
- An understanding of [managed solution layers](/power-platform/alm/solution-layers-alm#layering-within-a-managed-solution)
- (Optional, but recommended) A [Developer plan](/power-apps/maker/developer-plan) so you can export your solution to easily deploy in other environments

## Create a managed solution to layer over the PMO Accelerator

This process has three main steps:

1. Select (or create) a development environment where you're an admin, and where Project for the web and the Accelerator solution are deployed&mdash;or deploy them, if they aren't there yet.
1. In that environment, create a managed solution that contains your customizations.
1. Export the solution, and then import it into your production Project+Accelerator environment.

## Example customization: add an action to send email when a Project Request is approved

The cloud flow included with the *Project Requests* scenario is very simple; it creates a project from a request when *Request State* is set to *Approved*. By adding an action to the cloud flow, you can make it also send an email notification.

1. Open the [Power Apps Portal](https://make.powerapps.com) and select your development environment.
1. In the list of solutions, select **Project Management Office Accelerator**.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Cloud Flows**.
1. Select **When the request state is updated to Approved** to open it.
1. On the command bar, select **Edit**.
1. Select **+ New step**.
1. Under **Choose an operation**, enter *Out* and then select **Office 365 Outlook**.

1. Select fields inside the connector to add content. Power Apps offers suggestions depending on the field you select. For example, when you select the **Subject** field you see attributes you can add. When the flow runs, the value of the attribute appears in the generated email.

1. Your Outlook step should look something like this example:

1. Save and close the flow.
1. On the command bar, select **Publish all customizations**.

## Disable the flow

1. Open the [Power Apps Portal](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. In the navigation pane, select **Solutions**, and then select **Project Management Office Accelerator**.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Cloud Flows**.
1. Select the **When the request state is updated to Approved** flow. Then, on the command bar select the ellipses (**...**) and then select **Turn Off**.

1. On the command bar, select **Publish all customizations**.
