# Deploy the Project Management Office Accelerator

Although people in your organization can start using Project for the web as soon as you subscribe to Microsoft 365, you'll probably want to customize the environment to meet your specific business needs. Save time with several common scenarios by deploying the Project Management Office Accelerator (PMO Accelerator).

## Prerequisites

- Admin rights in an environment with the [deployed Project for the web solution](/project-for-the-web/deploying-project).
- Rights to create Power Automate flows using the [Common Data Service connector](/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/).

## Deploy the Accelerator

1. Download the [Accelerator](https://aka.ms/latestPMOaccelerator) and save it locally. Don't unpack it&mdash;the import process uses the zipped file.
1. Open the [Power Apps Portal](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. Open the **Environment** menu and select your Project for the web environment.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Solutions**.
1. On the command bar, select **Import**.
1. In the **Import a solution** dialog, select **Browse**, then find and select the Accelerator file you downloaded.
1. Select **Next**, then select an existing connection to a Power Automate flow, or create a new connection.
1. Select **Next** and then select **Import**.

When deployment succeeds, the Project Power App will resemble this:

## Use the Accelerator components without Project for the web

You may reuse the Accelerator components in your own applications, per the [LICENSE](/OfficeDev/Project-Accelerator/blob/main/LICENSE). Using the Accelerator with the Project Power App or using the Project for the web tables employed by the Accelerator is only permitted according to the terms of your Project plan and subscriptions.

## Resolve error messages that appear during deployment

The following table lists known errors that sometimes appear while you are deploying the Accelerator solution, and provides steps to resolve them. If the steps don't resolve the error, you can [get support from Microsoft](#accelerator-support-options).

| Error message | Fix |
| :-- | :-- |
| **There are missing dependencies. Install the following solutions before installing this one: "msdyn_ProjectServiceCore (1.0.0.87)".** | In the environment where you're deploying the Accelerator, select **Solutions** in the navigation pane. Find the *Project Service Core* solution, and then select **Update** next to the solution name. After the update is complete, deploy the Accelerator solution. |

## Support and Troubleshooting

Microsoft fully supports the deployment and use of the Accelerator with Project for the web. Although we don't support any customizations added on top of the Accelerator, we do support the core functionality in such circumstances.

### Accelerator support options

- Open a new service request through the Microsoft 365 admin center Support tab.
- Raise an [issue in Github](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Project-Accelerator/issues).

## Next Steps

- [Create a managed solution to add the Power BI template to the Project Management Office Accelerator](deploy-power-bi-template-project-for-web-accelerator.md).
- [Learn more about scheduling modes](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/project-support-blog/schedule-modes-and-task-and-resource-usage-in-project-for-the/ba-p/2656738).
