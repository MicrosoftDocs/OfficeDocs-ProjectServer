# Synchronize Project for the web tasks with Planner and To Do 

By default, Project for the web tasks with Planner and To Do is enabled for all tenants. This means that the Assigned to me view in Planner and To Do will display all Microsoft 365 tasks assigned to a user. 

However, there may be instances when disabling this synchronization at the tenant level would be helpful, such as if you require your data for Project for web and Planner to exist in two different data boundaries. 

## Admin controls to enable or disable synchronization

An admin can enable or disable Project for the web task synchronization with Planner and To Do for all users in their organization through the Project settings page in the Microsoft 365 admin center. 

Use the following steps to Enable or Disable Project for the web Task Syncing: 

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, expand the navigation menu, select **Settings**, and then select **Org Settings**. 
2. Select **Project**. 
3. On the Project settings page, select or clear the checkbox **Turn on Assigned to me view syncing for your organization**, and then select **Save**. 



Please note that Assigned to me view syncing (i.e. Project task syncing with Planner and To Do) can only be enabled if “Project for the web” has been enabled for the tenant. If the administrator decides to disable “Project for the web” for the tenant, Assigned to me view syncing will also be disabled and no new data will be copied to Planner and To Do. However, previously synchronized data will not be deleted until the Assigned to me view syncing is explicitly disabled for the tenant.
