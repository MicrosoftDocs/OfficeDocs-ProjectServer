# Office 365 User access to Project for the web and Roadmap

Applies to: Project for the web and Roadmap

An appropriate Project subscription (Project Plan 1, Project Plan 3, or Project Plan 5) is required for your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 users to create a  [Roadmap](https://support.office.com/article/Video-Welcome-to-Roadmap-57764149-51b8-468f-a50d-9ea6a4fd835a) or a [Project for the web](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2108301) plan. Users assigned with Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscriptions are allowed to have basic edit access to projects that are shared with them without needing to be assigned a Project subscription.

If your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 user needs to create projects or roadmaps, you'll need to purchase the appropriate Project subscription and assign it to the user.

> [!Note] 
> For more information about Project Plan subscriptions and understand what the capabilities of an Office 365 user are, see the [Project service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/project-online-service-description/project-online-service-description).

## Office 365 subscription with basic edit access

> [!Note] 
> The capabilities listed under Office 365 licenses are currently rolling out. Initially, Office 365 users will have view only access to shared projects, and Office 365 users with an E3 or E5 license can additionally edit percent complete on tasks assigned to them. When all capabilities have been successfully rolled out, Office 365 licensed users will have edit access to the areas described below.

Microsoft 365 and Office 365 users can now edit shared projects, enabling them to collaborate more seamlessly with Project users. These users can access any capabilities where Microsoft Project and Microsoft Planner for the web overlap. For example, the user could edit task name, assign tasks to others, and change the priority and start date of a task. Any non-overlapping fields, such as dependencies or custom fields, would still require a Project license to edit. 

Office 365 basic edit access applies to the following families of Office 365 suites and their education and GCC counterparts.

- Microsoft 365 F3 and Office 365 F3  
- Office 365 E1 
- Microsoft 365 for business 
- Microsoft E3 and Office 365 E3
- Microsoft E5 and Office 365 E5

> [!Note]
> The above access applies to projects created in Microsoft Project for the web. Office 365 view access applies to projects created in non-default Dataverse environments in the following families of Office 365 suites and their education and GCC counterparts: 
> - Microsoft 365 F3 and Office 365 F3  
> - Office 365 E1 
> - Microsoft 365 for business
> <p>Microsoft 365 and Office 365 users with E3 and E5 licenses in non-default Dataverse environments are able to view as well as mark a task as complete for tasks assigned to them in any project they have permissions to.

## Subscription for Project and Dataverse Apps  

Within each subscription, there are two apps that can be seen from the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- Project for Office (Plan X)
- Dataverse

In the table below, the "Plan" in the title of "Project for Office" comes from the family of Microsoft 365/Office 365 suites that include the “Project for Office” and “Dataverse” apps and directly applies to Project for the web and Roadmap. The “Project for Office (Plan X)” and “Dataverse” apps come with an appropriate Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription and provide the underpinnings to view and perform limited edits of plans built in Project for the web. These apps are not separate products and are only included within the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscriptions as outlined above in the Office 365 subscription with view access and Office 365 subscription with limited edit access sections.
