# Office 365 User access to Project for the web and Roadmap

Applies to: Project for the web and Roadmap

An appropriate Project subscription (Project Plan 1, Project Plan 3, or Project Plan 5) is required for your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 users to view a [Roadmap](https://support.office.com/article/Video-Welcome-to-Roadmap-57764149-51b8-468f-a50d-9ea6a4fd835a) or a [Project for the web](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2108301) plan. Users assigned with certain Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscriptions are allowed to have limited edit access to projects that are shared with them without needing to be assigned a Project subscription.

If your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 user needs to edit or create projects or roadmaps, you'll need to purchase the appropriate Project subscription and assign it to the user.

> [!Note] 
> For more information about Project Plan subscriptions and understand what the capabilities of an Office 365 user are, see the [Project service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/project-online-service-description/project-online-service-description).

## Office 365 subscription with view access

Users with appropriate Office license added to the Office 365 group of the project.

Office 365 view access applies to the following families of Office 365 suites and their education and GCC counterparts.

- Microsoft 365 F3 and Office 365 F3 
- Office 365 E1
- Microsoft 365 for business
- Microsoft E3 and Office 365 E3
- Microsoft E5 and Office 365 E5

## Office 365 subscription with limited edit access

Microsoft 365 and Office 365 users with E3 and E5 licenses can now mark a task as complete, or update the task progress or “% complete” of a task assigned to them in any project they have permissions to.

Office 365 limited edit access applies to the following families of Office 365 suites and their education and GCC counterparts.

- Microsoft E3 and Office 365 E3
- Microsoft E5 and Office 365 E5

## Subscription for Project and Dataverse Apps  

Within each subscription, there are two apps that can be seen from the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- Project for Office (Plan X)
- Dataverse

In the following table, the "Plan" in the title of "Project for Office" comes from the family of Microsoft 365 and Office 365 suites that includes the “Project for Office” and “Dataverse” apps and directly applies to Project for the web and Roadmap. The “Project for Office (Plan X)” and “Dataverse” apps come with an appropriate Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription and provide the underpinnings to view and perform limited edits of plans built in Project for the web. These apps are not separate products and are only included within the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscriptions as outlined previously in the Office 365 subscription with view access and Office 365 subscription with limited edit access sections.

Additionally, both the Project for Office and Dataverse apps within the same subscription must be assigned to the user to view or perform limited edits to plans built in Project for the web or to view a Roadmap.
