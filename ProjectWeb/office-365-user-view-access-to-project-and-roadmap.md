# Office 365 User view access to Project and Roadmap

An appropriate Project Plan license is required for your Office 365 users to use [Project for the web](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2108301) or [Roadmap](https://support.office.com/article/Video-Welcome-to-Roadmap-57764149-51b8-468f-a50d-9ea6a4fd835a). However, users that are assigned certain Office 365 licenses are allowed to have view access to Project for the web and Roadmap. 
This provision will allow them to have read-only access to projects and roadmaps that are shared with them, without needing to be assigned a Project Plan license.

 If your users need to be able to edit or create projects or roadmaps, you will need to purchase the appropriate Project Plan license and assign it to the user.

> [!Note] 
> For more information about Project Plan subscriptions and understand what the capabilities of an Office 365 user are, see the [Project service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/project-online-service-description/project-online-service-description).

## Office 365 subscription with view access

Office 365 view access applies to the following families of Office 365 suites and their education counterparts.

- Microsoft 365 F3 and Office 365 F3
- Office 365 E1
- Microsoft 365 for business
- Microsoft E3 and Office 365 E3
- Microsoft E5 and Office 365 E5

Within each subscription, there are two apps that can be seen from the Microsoft 365 Admin center.

- Project for Office (Plan X)
- Common Data Service

The "Plan" in the title of Project for Office comes from the family of suite the app is included in. Both apps (from the same subscription) must be assigned to the user to view Project for the web or Roadmap.
