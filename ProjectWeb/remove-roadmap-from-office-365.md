# Remove Project for the web or Roadmap from Microsoft 365

You can turn Project for the web or Roadmap off in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This setting prevents your users from using them, but will not remove any user data that currently exists. 

> [!NOTE]
> It may take a few minutes for functionality to be disabled while the setting synchronizes across your tenant.

**To turn off Project for the web:**

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), under **Settings**, click **Org settings**.
2. Click **Project**.
3. Uncheck **Turn on Project for the web**.
4. Click **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> Although this setting currently displays in your Project settings, it will not be enabled until a later date (see your Message Center). You can still [turn off Project for the web for individual users](turn-project-for-the-web-off.md). 

**To turn off Roadmap:**

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), under **Settings**, click **Org settings**.
2. Click **Project**.
3. Uncheck **Turn on Roadmap for your organization**.
4. Click **Save**.

If your Project Online subscription ends, most of the associated data is deleted in conformance with the [Data retention, deletion, and destruction in Microsoft 365](/compliance/assurance/assurance-data-retention-deletion-and-destruction-overview). Unlike other Project Online data, Project for the web and Roadmap data isnâ€™t automatically deleted when your Project Online subscription ends.

## Remove Project for the web and Roadmap data

You can remove all Project for the web and Roadmap data by removing the entire solution from Microsoft 365. This removal deletes all of the existing projects, roadmaps, and associated user data.

**To remove Roadmap:** (Only applies to the default organization as Roadmap can only be installed on the default organization)

1. In the [Microsoft 365 App Launcher](https://support.microsoft.com/office/79f12104-6fed-442f-96a0-eb089a3f476a), click **Power Apps** (or as an alternative, you can go to [https://make.powerapps.com/](https://make.powerapps.com/)).
1. Ensure that the default organization is selected at the top of the page; if not, change it to the default organization. (As noted above, Roadmap can only be installed on the default organization; as such, it is the only organization where you can remove the roadmap from.)
1. Click on the settings icon on the top right of the page and go to **Advanced Settings**.
1. On the **Settings** menu, under **Customization**, click **Solutions**.
1. Select the **PortfolioService** solution, and then click **Delete**.
1. Select the **PortfolioService_Anchor** solution, and then click **Delete**.
1. Select any solutions with a naming format of **PortfolioService_Patch_(number)**, (for example, PortfolioService_Patch_1 or PortfolioService_Patch_2), and then click **Delete**.

> [!NOTE]
> Removing the Roadmap solution does not affect any of the projects or tasks that the roadmaps are connected to.
