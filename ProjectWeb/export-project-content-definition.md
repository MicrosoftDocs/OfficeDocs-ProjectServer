| offsets       | JSONArray | The number of seconds to add to the start of the contour to indicate the start of the segment. |
| durations     | JSONArray | Duration in seconds of each segment.                                                           |
| work          | JSONArray | Work in seconds of each segment.                                                               |

Example

```json
        "remainingWorkContour": {
            "start": "2022-12-08T09:00:00Z",
            "offsets": [ 0, 54000 ],

            "work": [ 27000.0, 1800.0 ]
			}
```

Segment X

- Start = "start" + X offset in seconds
- Duration = duration of segment X in seconds
- Work = work of segment X in seconds

The contour starts on 2023-02-13T09:00:00Z

- Segment 1:
  - Start = 2022-12-08T09:00:00Z + 0 seconds -> 2022-12-08T09:00:00Z
  - Duration = 54000 seconds -> 900 Minutes -> 15 hours is the length of the segment
  - Work = 27000 seconds -> 450 Minutes -> 7.5 hours of work in the segment
- Segment 2:
  - Start = 2023-02-13T18:00:00Z + 54000 seconds (15 hours) -> 2022-12-09T00:00:00Z
  - Duration = 3600 seconds -> 60 Minutes -> 1 hours is the length of the segment
  - Work = 1800 seconds -> 30 Minutes -> 0.5 hours of work in the segment
