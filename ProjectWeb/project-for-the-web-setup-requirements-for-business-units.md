# Project for the web setup requirements for Dynamics 365 business units

In Dynamics 365, you can create more [business units](/power-platform/admin/create-edit-business-units) in your Dataverse instance. If you want Project for the web users in the business unit to be able to access and use it, you need to make sure that the associated team in which your users are members have the **Project Common** and **Project User** roles applied to it.

> [!NOTE]
> You only need to do this if you add a new business unit to your default CDS instance. This will automatically be applied to your root business unit's team settings.

## To apply the Project User role to a business unit

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a Global Admin to do this.

4. On the Dynamics 365 Settings page, click the **Settings** menu in the toolbar, and in the **Systems** section, select **Security**.
